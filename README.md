# GraphicsAdvancedMasterclass

This is a project that I develop alongside the graphics advanced masterclass at BUAS, presented by Jacco Bikker. It will involve raytracing and pathtracing on the CPU, and eventually moving that to the GPU, as well as building your own acceleration structures.

Current: Path tracer (Work in progress)
Features:
- Soft shadows
- Bounding volume hierarchies (Triangle primitives only)
- Diffuse reflections

Previous: Whitted-style raytracer (Finished)
Features:
- Direct illumination from multiple light sources
  - Shadow rays
  - Distance attenuation
  - Lambert diffuse, N dot L
- Pure specular reflections (recursive)
- Dielectric materials like glass (recursive)
- Beer's law (absorption within medium)
